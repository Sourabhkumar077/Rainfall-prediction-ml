# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques to predict rainfall based on historical weather data. The workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and uses Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

## Project Structure

- `Rainfall_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the code, data analysis, and model building steps.
- `Rainfall.csv`: Dataset containing historical weather and rainfall data.
- `venv/`: (Optional) Python virtual environment directory.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Rainfall prediction based on input features

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/EDUNET-ML.git
   cd EDUNET-ML
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Or, if requirements.txt is not present:
   pip install notebook numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `Rainfall_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb` in your browser and run the cells.

## Usage
- Run the notebook cell by cell to follow the data analysis and model building process.
- Modify the code as needed to experiment with different models or datasets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset (`Rainfall.csv`) should be present in the project directory. It contains historical weather data used for rainfall prediction.
